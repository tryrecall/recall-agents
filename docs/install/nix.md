# Nix Installation

Install Recall declaratively with **[nix-recall](https://github.com/recall/nix-recall)** -- a batteries-included Home Manager module.

<Info>
The [nix-recall](https://github.com/recall/nix-recall) repo is the source of truth for Nix installation. This page is a quick overview.
</Info>

## What You Get

- Gateway + macOS app + tools (whisper, spotify, cameras) -- all pinned
- Launchd service that survives reboots
- Plugin system with declarative config
- Instant rollback: `home-manager switch --rollback`

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Determinate Nix">
    If Nix is not already installed, follow the [Determinate Nix installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a local flake">
    Use the agent-first template from the nix-recall repo:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/code/recall-local
    # Copy templates/agent-first/flake.nix from the nix-recall repo
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure secrets">
    Set up your messaging bot token and model provider API key. Plain files at `~/.secrets/` work fine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in template placeholders and switch">
    ```bash
    home-manager switch
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Confirm the launchd service is running and your bot responds to messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See the [nix-recall README](https://github.com/recall/nix-recall) for full module options and examples.

## Nix Mode Runtime Behavior

When `RECALL_NIX_MODE=1` is set (automatic with nix-recall), Recall enters a deterministic mode that disables auto-install flows.

You can also set it manually:

```bash
export RECALL_NIX_MODE=1
```

On macOS, the GUI app does not automatically inherit shell environment variables. Enable Nix mode via defaults instead:

```bash
defaults write ai.tryrecall.mac recall.nixMode -bool true
```

### What changes in Nix mode

- Auto-install and self-mutation flows are disabled
- Missing dependencies surface Nix-specific remediation messages
- UI surfaces a read-only Nix mode banner

### Config and state paths

Recall reads JSON5 config from `RECALL_CONFIG_PATH` and stores mutable data in `RECALL_STATE_DIR`. When running under Nix, set these explicitly to Nix-managed locations so runtime state and config stay out of the immutable store.

| Variable               | Default                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `RECALL_HOME`        | `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` / `os.homedir()` |
| `RECALL_STATE_DIR`   | `~/.recall`                           |
| `RECALL_CONFIG_PATH` | `$RECALL_STATE_DIR/recall.json`     |
