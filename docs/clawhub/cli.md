# ClawHub CLI

Two command-line surfaces talk to ClawHub:

- `steelengine skills` / `steelengine plugins` - discover, install, and update
  packages for a local SteelEngine agent or Gateway.
- The standalone `clawhub` CLI - publisher workflows: login, publish, sync,
  and transfer.

## Discover and install

```bash
steelengine skills search "calendar"
steelengine skills install @owner/<slug>
steelengine skills install @owner/<slug> --version <version> --global
steelengine skills update @owner/<slug>
steelengine skills update --all --acknowledge-clawhub-risk
steelengine skills verify @owner/<slug> --card

steelengine plugins search "calendar"
steelengine plugins install clawhub:<package>
steelengine plugins install clawhub:<package> --acknowledge-clawhub-risk
steelengine plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>
steelengine plugins update --all
```

Skill installs target the active workspace `skills/` directory by default; add
`--global` for the shared managed skills directory. Plugin installs need the
explicit `clawhub:` prefix to force ClawHub resolution over npm, git, or a
local path. Full flag reference: [`steelengine skills`](/cli/skills) and
[`steelengine plugins`](/cli/plugins).

### Release trust

SteelEngine checks a release's ClawHub trust state before downloading it, for
both skills and plugins. Versioned releases use exact-release trust metadata;
resolver-backed GitHub skills go through ClawHub's install resolver, which
enforces scan and force-install policy before returning a pinned commit.

- **Malicious or blocked** releases are refused outright.
- **Risky** releases (non-clean scan, non-blocking moderation state) print a
  warning and require `--acknowledge-clawhub-risk` to continue
  non-interactively.
- **Official ClawHub publishers/packages and bundled SteelEngine sources** skip
  the trust prompt and security-verdict fetch entirely.

## Publish and maintain

Install the standalone CLI once, then log in:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
clawhub login
```

Publish a plugin package (folder path, GitHub repo `owner/repo[@ref]`, or
tarball URL) with `clawhub package publish`:

```bash
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin@v1.0.0
```

Publish a skill folder with `clawhub skill publish`:

```bash
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper --version 1.0.0 --owner your-org
```

Other maintenance commands:

```bash
clawhub sync --all                                          # scan local skills, publish new/updated ones
clawhub package transfer @old-owner/package --to new-owner   # move a plugin package to another publisher
clawhub skill rename old-slug new-slug                       # rename a published skill, redirect the old slug
clawhub explore --sort trending                              # browse the registry, sorted by trending
```
