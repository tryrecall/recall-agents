# `steelengine hooks`

Manage agent hooks (event-driven automations for commands like `/new`, `/reset`, and gateway startup). Bare `steelengine hooks` is equivalent to `steelengine hooks list`.

Related: [Hooks](/automation/hooks) - [Plugin hooks](/plugins/hooks)

## List hooks

```bash
steelengine hooks list [--eligible] [--json] [-v|--verbose]
```

Lists hooks discovered from workspace, managed, extra, and bundled directories.

- `--eligible`: only hooks whose requirements are met.
- `--json`: structured output.
- `-v, --verbose`: include a Missing column with unmet requirements.

```
Hooks (4/5 ready)

Ready:
  🚀 boot-md ✓ - Run BOOT.md on gateway startup
  📎 bootstrap-extra-files ✓ - Inject additional workspace bootstrap files during agent bootstrap
  📝 command-logger ✓ - Log all command events to a centralized audit file
  💾 session-memory ✓ - Save session context to memory when /new or /reset command is issued
```

## Get hook info

```bash
steelengine hooks info <name> [--json]
```

`<name>` is the hook name or hook key (for example `session-memory`). Shows source, file/handler paths, homepage, events, and per-requirement status (binaries, env, config, OS).

## Check eligibility

```bash
steelengine hooks check [--json]
```

Prints a ready/not-ready count summary; with hooks not ready, lists each with its blocking reason.

## Enable a hook

```bash
steelengine hooks enable <name>
```

Adds/updates `hooks.internal.entries.<name>.enabled = true` in config and also flips the `hooks.internal.enabled` master switch on (the gateway does not load any internal hook handler until at least one is configured). Fails if the hook does not exist, is plugin-managed, or is not eligible (missing requirements).

Plugin-managed hooks show `plugin:<id>` in `hooks list` and cannot be enabled/disabled here; enable or disable the owning plugin instead.

Restart the gateway after enabling (macOS menu bar app restart, or restart your gateway process in dev) so it reloads hooks.

## Disable a hook

```bash
steelengine hooks disable <name>
```

Sets `hooks.internal.entries.<name>.enabled = false`. Restart the gateway afterward.

## Install and update hook packs

```bash
steelengine plugins install <package>        # npm by default
steelengine plugins install npm:<package>    # npm only
steelengine plugins install <package> --pin  # pin resolved version
steelengine plugins install <path>           # local directory or archive
steelengine plugins install -l <path>        # link a local directory instead of copying

steelengine plugins update <id>
steelengine plugins update --all
steelengine plugins update --dry-run
```

Hook packs install through the unified plugins installer/updater; `steelengine hooks install` / `steelengine hooks update` still work as deprecated aliases that print a warning and forward to the `plugins` commands.

- Npm specs are registry-only: package name plus an optional exact version or dist-tag. Git/URL/file specs and semver ranges are rejected. Dependency installs run project-local with `--ignore-scripts`.
- Bare specs and `@latest` stay on the stable track; if npm resolves to a prerelease, SteelEngine stops and asks you to opt in explicitly (`@beta`, `@rc`, or an exact prerelease version).
- Supported archives: `.zip`, `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar`.
- `-l, --link` links a local directory instead of copying it (adds it to `hooks.internal.load.extraDirs`); linked hook packs are managed hooks from an operator-configured directory, not workspace hooks.
- `--pin` records npm installs as an exact resolved `name@version` in `hooks.internal.installs`.
- Install copies the pack into `~/.steelengine/hooks/<id>`, enables its hooks under `hooks.internal.entries.*`, and records the install under `hooks.internal.installs`.
- If a stored integrity hash no longer matches the fetched artifact, SteelEngine warns and prompts before continuing; pass global `--yes` to bypass the prompt (for example in CI).

## Bundled hooks

| Hook                  | Events                                            | What it does                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| boot-md               | `gateway:startup`                                 | Runs `BOOT.md` at gateway startup for each configured agent scope                                  |
| bootstrap-extra-files | `agent:bootstrap`                                 | Injects extra bootstrap files (for example monorepo `AGENTS.md`/`TOOLS.md`) during agent bootstrap |
| command-logger        | `command`                                         | Logs command events to `~/.steelengine/logs/commands.log`                                             |
| compaction-notifier   | `session:compact:before`, `session:compact:after` | Sends visible chat notices when session compaction starts and finishes                             |
| session-memory        | `command:new`, `command:reset`                    | Saves session context to memory on `/new` or `/reset`                                              |

Enable any bundled hook with `steelengine hooks enable <hook-name>`. Full details, config keys, and defaults: [Bundled hooks](/automation/hooks#bundled-hooks).

### command-logger log file

```bash
tail -n 20 ~/.steelengine/logs/commands.log        # recent commands
cat ~/.steelengine/logs/commands.log | jq .          # pretty-print
grep '"action":"new"' ~/.steelengine/logs/commands.log | jq .   # filter by action
```

## Notes

- `hooks list --json`, `info --json`, and `check --json` write structured JSON directly to stdout.
