```

Running `steelengine migrate <provider>` with no other flags plans, previews, and (in a TTY) prompts before applying. `steelengine migrate plan <provider>` and `steelengine migrate apply <provider>` split preview and apply into separate subcommands with the same flags.

<ParamField path="<provider>" type="string">
  Name of a registered migration provider, for example `hermes`. Run `steelengine migrate list` to see installed providers.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--dry-run" type="boolean">
  Build the plan and exit without changing state.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--from <path>" type="string">
  Override the source state directory. Hermes follows `$HERMES_HOME` and the active profile, then uses the platform default (`~/.hermes` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`). Codex defaults to `~/.codex` (or `$CODEX_HOME`), Claude defaults to `~/.claude`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--include-secrets" type="boolean">
  Import supported credentials without prompting. Interactive apply asks before importing detected auth credentials, with yes selected by default; non-interactive `--yes` requires `--include-secrets` to import them.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--no-auth-credentials" type="boolean">
  Skip auth credential import, including the interactive prompt.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--overwrite" type="boolean">
  Allow apply to replace existing targets when the plan reports conflicts.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--yes" type="boolean">
  Skip the confirmation prompt. Required in non-interactive mode.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--skill <name>" type="string">
  Select one skill copy item by skill name or item id. Repeat the flag to migrate multiple skills. When omitted, interactive Codex migrations show a checkbox selector and non-interactive migrations keep all planned skills.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--plugin <name>" type="string">
  Select one Codex plugin install item by plugin name or item id. Repeat the flag to migrate multiple Codex plugins. When omitted, interactive Codex migrations show a native Codex plugin checkbox selector and non-interactive migrations keep all planned plugins. Applies only to source-installed `openai-curated` Codex plugins discovered by the Codex app-server inventory.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--verify-plugin-apps" type="boolean">
  Codex only. Forces a fresh source Codex app-server `app/list` traversal before planning native plugin activation. Off by default to keep migration planning fast.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--backup-output <path>" type="string">
  Pre-migration backup archive path or directory. Passed through to `steelengine backup create`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--no-backup" type="boolean">
  Skip the pre-apply backup. Requires `--force` when local SteelEngine state exists.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--force" type="boolean">
  Required alongside `--no-backup` when apply would otherwise refuse to skip the backup.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--json" type="boolean">
  Print the plan or apply result as JSON. With `--json` and no `--yes`, apply prints the plan and does not mutate state.
</ParamField>

## Safety model

`steelengine migrate` is preview-first.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Preview before apply">
    The provider returns an itemized plan before anything changes, including conflicts, skipped items, and sensitive items. JSON plans, apply output, and migration reports redact nested secret-looking keys such as API keys, tokens, authorization headers, cookies, and passwords.

    `steelengine migrate apply <provider>` previews the plan and prompts before changing state unless `--yes` is set. In non-interactive mode, apply requires `--yes`.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Backups">
    Apply creates and verifies an SteelEngine backup before applying the migration. If no local SteelEngine state exists yet, the backup step is skipped and the migration continues. To skip a backup when state exists, pass both `--no-backup` and `--force`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflicts">
    Apply refuses to continue when the plan has conflicts. Review the plan, then rerun with `--overwrite` if replacing existing targets is intentional. Providers may still write item-level backups for overwritten files in the migration report directory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secrets">
    Interactive apply asks whether to import detected auth credentials, with yes selected by default. Use `--no-auth-credentials` to skip them, or `--include-secrets` for unattended credential import with `--yes`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claude provider

The bundled Claude provider detects Claude Code state at `~/.claude` by default. Use `--from <path>` to import a specific Claude Code home or project root.

<Tip>
For a user-facing walkthrough, see [Migrating from Claude](/install/migrating-claude).
</Tip>

### What Claude imports

- Claude Code auto-memory Markdown from `~/.claude/projects/*/memory` and a
  user-configured `autoMemoryDirectory`, copied under
  `memory/imports/claude-code/` for indexed recall.
- Project `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` into the SteelEngine agent workspace (`AGENTS.md`).
- User `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` appended to workspace `USER.md`.
- MCP server definitions from project `.mcp.json`, Claude Code `~/.claude.json` (including its per-project entries), and Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- Claude skill directories that include `SKILL.md` (user `~/.claude/skills` and project `.claude/skills`).
- Claude command Markdown files (user `~/.claude/commands` and project `.claude/commands`) converted into SteelEngine skills with manual invocation only.

### Archive and manual-review state

Claude hooks, permissions, environment defaults, project `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/rules`, user and project `agents/` directories, and project history (`projects`, `cache`, `plans` under `~/.claude`) are preserved in the migration report or reported as manual-review items. SteelEngine does not execute hooks, copy broad allowlists, or import OAuth/Desktop credential state automatically.

## Codex provider

The bundled Codex provider detects Codex CLI state at `~/.codex` by default, or at `CODEX_HOME` when that environment variable is set. Use `--from <path>` to inventory a specific Codex home.

Use this provider when moving to the SteelEngine Codex harness and you want to promote useful personal Codex CLI assets deliberately. Local Codex app-server launches use a per-agent `CODEX_HOME`, so they do not read your personal `~/.codex` by default. The normal process `HOME` is still inherited, so Codex can see shared `$HOME/.agents/*` skills/plugin marketplace entries and subprocesses can find user-home config and tokens.

Running `steelengine migrate codex` in an interactive terminal previews the full plan, then opens checkbox selectors before the final apply confirmation. Skill copy items are prompted first. Use `Toggle all on` or `Toggle all off` for bulk selection. Press Space to toggle rows, or Enter to activate the highlighted row and continue. Planned skills start checked, conflict skills start unchecked, and `Skip for now` skips skill copies for this run while still continuing to plugin selection. When source-installed curated Codex plugins are migratable and `--plugin` was not supplied, migration then prompts for native Codex plugin activation by plugin name. Plugin items start checked unless the target SteelEngine Codex plugin config already has that plugin. Existing target plugins start unchecked and show a conflict hint such as `conflict: plugin exists`; choose `Toggle all off` to migrate no native Codex plugins in that run, or `Skip for now` to stop before applying.

For scripted or exact runs, select one or more skills or plugins explicitly:

```bash
steelengine migrate codex --dry-run --skill gog-vault77-google-workspace
steelengine migrate apply codex --yes --skill gog-vault77-google-workspace
steelengine migrate codex --dry-run --plugin google-calendar
steelengine migrate apply codex --yes --plugin google-calendar
```

### What Codex imports

- Consolidated Codex `MEMORY.md` and `memory_summary.md` from
  `$CODEX_HOME/memories`, copied under `memory/imports/codex/` for indexed
  recall. Raw rollout memory is not imported.
- Codex CLI skill directories under `$CODEX_HOME/skills`, excluding Codex's `.system` cache.
- Personal AgentSkills under `$HOME/.agents/skills`, copied into the current SteelEngine agent workspace for per-agent ownership.
- Source-installed `openai-curated` Codex plugins discovered through Codex app-server `plugin/list`. Planning reads `plugin/read` for each enabled installed plugin.

App-backed plugin migration has extra gates:

- App-backed plugins require the source Codex app-server account to be a ChatGPT subscription account. Non-ChatGPT or missing account responses are skipped with `codex_subscription_required`.
- By default, migration does not call source `app/list`, so app-backed plugins that pass the account gate are planned without source app-accessibility verification, and account-lookup transport failures skip with `codex_account_unavailable`.
- Pass `--verify-plugin-apps` to force a fresh source `app/list` snapshot and require every owned app to be present, enabled, and accessible before planning native activation. In that mode, account-lookup transport failures fall through to source app-inventory verification. The snapshot is kept in memory for the current process only; it is never written to migration output or target config.

Disabled plugins, unreadable plugin details, subscription-gated source accounts, and (when `--verify-plugin-apps` is set) missing, disabled, or inaccessible apps become manual skipped items with typed reasons instead of target config entries. Apply calls app-server `plugin/install` for each selected eligible plugin, even if the target app-server already reports that plugin as installed and enabled. Migrated Codex plugins are usable only in sessions that select the native Codex harness; they are not exposed to SteelEngine provider runs, ACP conversation bindings, or other harnesses.

### Manual-review Codex state

Codex `config.toml`, native `hooks/hooks.json`, non-curated marketplaces, cached plugin bundles that are not source-installed curated plugins, and source-installed plugins that fail the source subscription gate are not activated automatically. When `--verify-plugin-apps` is set, plugins that fail the source app-inventory gate are also skipped. All of these are copied or reported in the migration report for manual review.

For migrated source-installed curated plugins, apply writes:

- `plugins.entries.codex.enabled: true`
- `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.enabled: true`
- `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.allow_destructive_actions: true`
- one explicit plugin entry with `marketplaceName: "openai-curated"` and `pluginName` for each selected plugin

Migration never writes `plugins["*"]` and never stores local marketplace cache paths.

Skipped plugins are not written to target config. Source-side subscription failures are reported on manual items with typed reasons: `codex_subscription_required`, `codex_account_unavailable`, `plugin_disabled`, or `plugin_read_unavailable`. With `--verify-plugin-apps`, source app-inventory failures can also appear as `app_inaccessible`, `app_disabled`, `app_missing`, or `app_inventory_unavailable`. Target-side auth-required installs are reported on the affected plugin item with `status: "skipped"`, `reason: "auth_required"`, and sanitized app identifiers; their explicit config entries are written disabled until you reauthorize and enable them. Other install failures are item-scoped `error` results.

If Codex app-server plugin inventory is unavailable during planning, migration falls back to cached bundle advisory items instead of failing the whole migration.

## Hermes provider

The bundled Hermes provider follows `$HERMES_HOME` and the active profile, then uses the platform default (`~/.hermes` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`). Use `--from <path>` to override discovery.

### What Hermes imports

- Default model configuration from `config.yaml`.
- Configured model providers and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints from `model`, `providers`, and `custom_providers`.
- MCP server definitions from `mcp_servers` or `mcp.servers`. Exact SteelEngine mappings cover default Streamable HTTP routing, OAuth scope, boolean TLS verification, separate client certificate/key paths, and Hermes native/resource/prompt tool policy. Unsupported Hermes-only runtime or credential fields are reported for manual review.
- `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md` into the SteelEngine agent workspace.
- `memories/MEMORY.md` and `memories/USER.md` appended to workspace memory files.
  Memory-only surfaces (the onboarding memory page and the Control UI Memory
  import page) instead copy these files under `memory/imports/hermes/` for
  indexed recall without touching existing workspace memory.
- Memory config defaults for SteelEngine file memory, plus archive or manual-review items for external memory providers such as Honcho.
- Skills that include a `SKILL.md` file anywhere under `skills/`; nested skills are flattened into the workspace skill directory.
- Per-skill config values from `skills.config`.
- Current Hermes OpenAI Codex OAuth credentials and OpenCode OpenAI OAuth credentials when interactive credential migration is accepted, or when `--include-secrets` is set. Do not keep Hermes and SteelEngine using the same imported refresh grant.
- Supported API keys and tokens from Hermes `.env` and OpenCode `auth.json` when interactive credential migration is accepted, or when `--include-secrets` is set.

### Supported `.env` keys

`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `ALIBABA_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ARCEEAI_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `CHUTES_API_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GLM_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN`, `KILOCODE_API_KEY`, `KIMICODE_API_KEY`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_CODING_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_CODING_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `MODELSTUDIO_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `QIANFAN_API_KEY`, `QWEN_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, `VENICE_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `XIAOMI_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `Z_AI_API_KEY`.

### Archive-only state

Hermes state that SteelEngine cannot safely interpret is copied into the migration report for manual review, but it is not loaded into live SteelEngine config or credentials. This includes `plugins/`, `sessions/`, `logs/`, `cron/`, `mcp-tokens/`, `plans/`, `workspace/`, `skins/`, `kanban/`, pairing/platform state, gateway routing/process state, and the detected Hermes SQLite databases.

### After applying

```bash
steelengine doctor
```

## Plugin contract

Migration sources are plugins. A plugin declares its provider ids in `steelengine.plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "migrationProviders": ["hermes"]
  }
}
```

At runtime the plugin calls `api.registerMigrationProvider(...)`. The provider implements `detect`, `plan`, and `apply`. Core owns CLI orchestration, backup policy, prompts, JSON output, and conflict preflight. Core passes the reviewed plan into `apply(ctx, plan)`, and providers may rebuild the plan only when that argument is absent for compatibility.

Provider plugins can use `steelengine/plugin-sdk/migration` for item construction and summary counts, plus `steelengine/plugin-sdk/migration-runtime` for conflict-aware file copies, archive-only report copies, cached config-runtime wrappers, and migration reports.

## Onboarding integration

Onboarding can offer migration when a provider detects a known source. Both `steelengine onboard --flow import` and `steelengine setup --wizard --import-from hermes` use the same plugin migration provider and still show a preview before applying.

<Note>
Onboarding imports require a fresh SteelEngine setup. Reset config, credentials, sessions, and the workspace first if you already have local state. Backup-plus-overwrite or merge imports are feature-gated for existing setups.
